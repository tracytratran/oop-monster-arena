/**
 * monster.js — base class every monster extends.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * Monster uses two OOP patterns working together:
 *
 * - **Inheritance** — your monster class extends Monster and can override
 *   `onTakeDamage()`, `reset()`, and `imagePath`.
 * - **Composition** — HP is delegated to a HealthComponent (`this.hp`).
 *   Monster never touches HP directly; it calls `this.hp.heal()`,
 *   `this.hp.takeDamage()`, etc.
 *
 * ## Stat budget
 * Every monster must satisfy:
 *
 *   health + attackPower × 3 ≤ 300
 *
 * This keeps fights balanced regardless of stat distribution.
 * A monster can be tanky (high HP, low attack) or a glass cannon
 * (low HP, high attack) — the formula normalises both.
 *
 * ## Ability system
 * Pass a DamageAbility, HealAbility, or ArmorAbility to the constructor.
 * The engine calls `ability.tryActivate(this, opponent)` after every attack.
 * You do not need to call it yourself.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 * Each tournament bout resets all monsters to full HP via `reset()`.
 * If you store extra state (counters, swapped abilities), override `reset()`
 * and call `super.reset()` first.
 *
 * ## Quick-start example
 * ```js
 * import { Monster } from '../core/monster.js';
 * import { DamageAbility } from '../core/ability.js';
 *
 * class FireSurge extends DamageAbility {
 *   activate(attacker, opponent) { return 30; }
 *   describe(attacker, amount) { return `${attacker.name} surges for ${amount}!`; }
 * }
 *
 * export class Phoenix extends Monster {
 *   constructor() {
 *     // STAT BUDGET: 150 + 50 × 3 = 300 ✓  (max 300)
 *     super('Phoenix', 150, 50, new FireSurge(30));
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
