/**
 * ability.js — three base ability types students extend to write their own.
 *
 * ## How abilities work
 * After every normal attack, the arena engine calls `ability.tryActivate()`.
 * If the roll succeeds and charges remain, it calls `activate()` to get the
 * effect amount, applies it via `_applyEffect()`, then calls `describe()` to
 * produce the battle log entry.
 *
 * You only need to override two methods:
 * - `activate(attacker, opponent)` — return the effect amount for this turn.
 * - `describe(attacker, amount)`   — return the battle log string.
 *
 * ## Trigger chance and the budget rule
 * Each ability type has a fixed budget. Trigger chance is derived automatically:
 *
 *   triggerChance = (budget × chargeMultiplier) / amount
 *
 * A higher `amount` means a stronger hit but a rarer trigger — the trade-off
 * is built in. You never set triggerChance directly.
 *
 * ## Charges and the budget
 * Charges are part of the budget. A limited-charge ability can fire at most N times
 * per bout, so each trigger is worth more — the budget scales up to compensate.
 * The multiplier is based on a reference of 5 expected triggers per bout (what an
 * unlimited ability would fire in a typical fight):
 *
 *   chargeMultiplier = 5 / min(charges, 5)
 *
 * | charges    | multiplier | DamageAbility budget |
 * |------------|------------|----------------------|
 * | ∞ (or ≥ 5) |    ×1.0    |          15          |
 * |     3      |    ×1.67   |          25           |
 * |     2      |    ×2.5    |         37.5          |
 * |     1      |    ×5.0    |          75           |
 *
 * A single-charge DamageAbility with amount ≤ 75 is guaranteed to fire (100%).
 * A 2-charge HealAbility at amount 30 now has 75% trigger chance instead of 40%.
 *
 * | Type          | Budget | amount 10 | amount 20 | amount 30 |
 * |---------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
 * | DamageAbility |   15   |   100%    |    75%    |    50%    |
 * | HealAbility   |   12   |   100%    |    60%    |    40%    |
 * | ArmorAbility  |    8   |    80%    |    40%    |    27%    |
 * (table above shows unlimited / ≥ 5 charges; finite charges raise all percentages)
 *
 * ## Charges (optional)
 * Pass a second argument to limit how many times the ability can fire per bout.
 * Omit it (or pass `Infinity`) for unlimited uses.
 *
 * ```js
 * new DamageAbility(40, 2)   // 2 charges → budget ×2.5 → 93% trigger chance
 * new DamageAbility(40)      // unlimited → budget ×1   → 37% trigger chance
 * new HealAbility(20)        // unlimited uses, 60% trigger
 * ```
 *
 * ## Dynamic amount
 * `activate()` can return a different amount each turn based on game state.
 * Trigger chance is recalculated live from whatever value you return.
 *
 * ```js
 * activate(attacker, opponent) {
 *   // grows stronger the more hits the attacker has taken
 *   return this.amount + attacker.hitsTaken * 5;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Quick-start example
 * ```js
 * import { DamageAbility } from '../core/ability.js';
 *
 * class VenomStrike extends DamageAbility {
 *   activate(attacker, opponent) {
 *     return 25; // fixed 25 damage → triggerChance = 15/25 = 60%
 *   }
 *   describe(attacker, amount) {
 *     return `${attacker.name} injects venom for ${amount} damage!`;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
